# TCP-Server-in-Rust
A TCP Server collects average of BTC-USD from TCP Client (it's available my github). You can check it by clicking the link in the note below.

This application connects to the client and gets the aggregated data of the BTC-USD from the clients and prints in the command line interface of server application.

Currently the server is listening to port 3333. To run this you can start by running ```cargo run``` command.

**Note:** Clone ```TCP-Client-in-rust``` (https://github.com/Av1nag/TCP-Client-in-Rust) to get connect with the suitable TCP client.

## Example installation steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Av1nag/TCP-Server-in-Rust.git
cd your-project
cargo build
```

## Steps to run the application

```bash
cargo run 
```
